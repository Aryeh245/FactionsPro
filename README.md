A modified plugin, better than ever. Being updated frequently. Edited by the VMPE development team. We update this plugin most of the time, features, bug fixes, and more. If you have any issues, or suggestions on what we should fix / add to this plugin, please open a new issue. We will make sure to read them. Thank you.

### WARNING / NOTE:
# This branch may be buggy. It isn't complete yet, and should not be used on production. Use it at your own risk.
# This branch allows you to customise: Faction commands, messages, error messages, usages, command names, and so much more.
# This will be useful on public servers in which want to customise their own faction features, renaming commands, and more. Also to make it customise their own as well. This is the official factions plugin to allow yourself as a server owner to customise your own Faction messages, and what not. Also, there is no download for this yet, as this branch is known to be buggy. We will update this message once we've made it stabled.
